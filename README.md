 Storing student's information in a hash table.

 Search() student's infor.
 
## Getting Started
Because GitHub automatically normalizes line endings of text files, hence my ListofStudent.txt will not work.
In the folder Hash-Table-Implementation-master open StudentList.docx, copy all the content to ListofStudent.txt in the Hashing folder -> save.
Then open Hashing.sln and run as usual.

- Open the Hashing_Show_Case.docx to see few examples.
- Check StudentHashTabe.txt in Hashing folder to see the display of the hash table.
